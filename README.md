# 🛒 E-Commerce Backend - Phase 1

Trying to develop a backend for an e-commerce system using Java Spring Boot framework.

## 📦 Phase 1 Goals

Build a **production-grade monolithic e-commerce backend** using:

- ✅ Clean Architecture
- ✅ Core Spring Boot Concepts
- ✅ JPA Mappings
- ✅ AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)
- ✅ Exception Handling
- ✅ Contextual Design Patterns

## 🧾 User Stories for Phase 1

| ID    | User Story |
|-------|------------|
| US-1  | As a user, I want to register with email/password to create an account. |
| US-2  | As a system, I want to prevent duplicate emails during registration. |
| US-3  | As a user, I want to log in and get a JWT token for secure access. |
| US-4  | As a user, I should be assigned the USER role by default. |
| US-5  | As an admin, I want to create new products. |
| US-6  | As a user, I want to view all products and get product details. |
| US-7  | As a user, I want to add products to my cart. |
| US-8  | As a user, I want to view and manage my cart (view/remove items). |
| US-9  | As a user, I want to place an order using the items in my cart. |
| US-10 | As a user, I want to view my previous orders. |
| US-11 | As an admin, I want to view all orders placed by users. |

## 🚀 API Endpoints to Implement (Phase 1)

### 🔐 Auth APIs

| Method | Endpoint              | Description                  |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/auth/register`   | Register a new user          |
| POST   | `/api/auth/login`      | Login with credentials (returns JWT) |

---

### 👤 User APIs

| Method | Endpoint                 | Description                 |
|--------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/users/me`          | Get logged-in user's profile |
| GET    | `/api/users/me/orders`   | Get user's order history     |
| GET    | `/api/users/me/cart`     | View user's current cart     |

---

### 🛒 Cart APIs

| Method | Endpoint                    | Description              |
|--------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/cart/add/{productId}`  | Add product to cart      |
| DELETE | `/api/cart/remove/{productId}` | Remove product from cart |
| GET    | `/api/cart`                  | View cart contents       |
| DELETE | `/api/cart/clear`            | Empty the cart           |

---

### 📦 Product APIs

| Method | Endpoint                        | Description          | Role   |
|--------|----------------------------------|----------------------|--------|
| GET    | `/api/products`                 | List all products    | PUBLIC |
| GET    | `/api/products/{id}`            | Get product details  | PUBLIC |
| POST   | `/api/admin/products`           | Create new product   | ADMIN  |
| PUT    | `/api/admin/products/{id}`      | Update product       | ADMIN  |
| DELETE | `/api/admin/products/{id}`      | Delete product       | ADMIN  |

---

### 📤 Order APIs

| Method | Endpoint                | Description             | Role  |
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------------|-------|
| POST   | `/api/orders`           | Place order using cart  | USER  |
| GET    | `/api/orders/me`        | View user’s own orders  | USER  |
| GET    | `/api/admin/orders`     | View all orders         | ADMIN |

---

## 🛡️ Role Assignment Logic (US-4)

- Happens automatically in `/auth/register`
- Every newly registered user is assigned: `ROLE_USER` by default

---

## 🔐 Security Rules

- All APIs except `/auth/*` and `GET /products` are **protected by JWT**
- Admin-only routes are secured with:  
  `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")`
- Cart and Orders are always **user-specific**  
  (based on the logged-in JWT user)

---

## 🧩 Optional Enhancements (Future)

| Feature              | Endpoint Idea                    |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Product search       | `/api/products/search?q=shoes`   |
| Order cancel/return  | `PATCH /api/orders/{id}/cancel`  |
| Payment integration  | `/api/orders/{id}/pay`           |

---

## ✅ Completed So Far

- [x] **US-1:** Register user via `POST /api/auth/register`
- [ ] US-2: Email duplication check
- [ ] US-3: Login and JWT
- [ ] Remaining user stories & APIs in progress...

## 📌 How to Run

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run

---

## Software Development Principles to be followed
- SOLID
- KISS
- DRY
- YAGNI

---

## Design Patterns

- Used Builder pattern by using Lombok in entities and DTOs.
- More Patterns to be used in future.
