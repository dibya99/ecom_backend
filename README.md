Trying to develop a backend for an e-commerce system using Java Springboot framework

Phase -1

Build a production-grade monolithic e-commerce backend using:
	‚Ä¢ Clean architecture
	‚Ä¢ Core Spring Boot concepts
	‚Ä¢ JPA mappings
	‚Ä¢ AOP
	‚Ä¢ Exception Handling
Design patterns applied contextually

üßæ User Stories for Phase 1
ID	User Story
US-1	As a user, I want to register with email/password to create an account.
US-2	As a system, I want to prevent duplicate emails during registration.
US-3	As a user, I want to log in and get a JWT token for secure access.
US-4	As a user, I should be assigned the USER role by default.
US-5	As an admin, I want to create new products.
US-6	As a user, I want to view all products and get product details.
US-7	As a user, I want to add products to my cart.
US-8	As a user, I want to view and manage my cart (view/remove items).
US-9	As a user, I want to place an order using the items in my cart.
US-10	As a user, I want to view my previous orders.
US-11	As an admin, I want to view all orders placed by users.


APIs to implement for Phase - I
 API List (Grouped by Feature)

üîê Auth APIs
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/auth/register	Register a new user
POST	/api/auth/login	Login with credentials (returns JWT token)

üì¶ Product APIs

GET	/api/orders/me	View user‚Äôs own orders	USER
GET	/api/admin/orders	View all orders	ADMIN


üõ°Ô∏è Role Assignment Logic (US-4)
	‚Ä¢ This happens automatically in backend logic when you register (/auth/register)
	‚Ä¢ Assigned: ROLE_USER by default

üß† Notes
	‚Ä¢ All APIs except /auth/* and GET /products should be protected by JWT
	‚Ä¢ Admin-only routes should be role-restricted using @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
	‚Ä¢ Cart is user-specific, so /api/cart is always scoped to logged-in user
	‚Ä¢ Order placement pulls from the current cart ‚Üí then clears the cart after placing order

üß© Optional Enhancements Later
Feature	Endpoint Idea
Product search	/api/products/search?q=shoes
Order cancel/return	PATCH /api/orders/{id}/cancel
Payment integration	/api/orders/{id}/pay


US-I : Completed, currently have a POST API to register user
